                        best actual croissant hands down, no wonder the store is called 'donut and croissant'. was a little skimpy on the filling, kevin wasn't pleased to find sausage in only the middle 50% of the sandwich. pretty cheesy at least. he thinks the golden gate sec is still the best, probably because they put two sausage patties in there.

                        i get why chinese oil sticks are also called crullers now since they’re identical in texture. crullers are lighter than the even regular raised donuts. the crumb is elastic and maybe a little rubbery. dough tastes pretty eggy, not sure it’s my favorite type of donut.
